    "A. Local Binary Patterns (LBP)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Description: LBP is a powerful texture descriptor. It compares the intensity of each pixel with its surrounding neighbors, encodes differences as binary patterns, and builds histograms of these patterns within regions or the entire image.\n",
    "    Why suitable for dental X-rays: Dental abnormalities (e.g., caries or cysts) are often characterized by specific texture patterns, and LBP captures these subtle texture differences effectively.\n",
    "    Steps:\n",
    "        Split the image into regions (e.g., patches around teeth or suspected areas).\n",
    "        Compute LBP histograms for each region.\n",
    "        Use the histograms as feature vectors for classification.\n",
    "    Applications:\n",
    "        Identifying caries based on surface texture variations.\n",
    "        Detecting cysts by contrasting the texture of healthy and abnormal areas.\n"
