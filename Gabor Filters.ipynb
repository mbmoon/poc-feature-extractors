    "Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Gabor filters are linear filters used to extract texture or spatial frequency information from images. They are defined by specific orientations and frequency scales, making them effective for analyzing localized edges and textures.\n",
    "    A Gabor filter responds to \"specific frequencies and orientations\" in an image, making it suitable for capturing edges and ridges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Apply Gabor filters to an image at different scales and orientations.\n",
    "    Extract features from the filter's responses (e.g., energy or magnitude).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Effective for capturing texture details and spatial structure.\n",
    "    Works well for images with repetitive patterns or fine textures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Fingerprint recognition (captures ridge-like structures).\n",
    "    Texture classification (e.g., fabric, paper, biological samples).\n",
    "    Object detection tasks requiring edge/texture information."
